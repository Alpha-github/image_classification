## Description
Stratify incorporates a python based-flask server, hosting a webpage, to upload and classify images using a custom trained model.(machine learning algorithms). 
There are three components to this project:

  - Web Server (Back end)
  - Image Classification model
  - HTML page 

### Technology

Stratify uses a number of open source platforms and packages to work properly:

* [Flask] - Flask is a microframework for Python based on Werkzeug, Jinja 2 and good intentions
* [Python] - An easy way to pick up proramming language and fun to play with
* [JavaScript] - JavaScript (JS) is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat.


### Setup

##### This was build on Windows 8.1.

These were the pre-requisities :

##### Create Clarifai Account
* [Clarifai] - Clarifai is an artificial intelligence (AI) company that specializes in computer vision and uses machine learning and deep neural networks to identify and analyze images and videos. Create an account in Clarifai under community plan and get started in training your custom model through Clarifai Portal.

### Installation
##### Install [Flask] using pip
```sh
$ pip install Flask
```
##### Install [Clarifai] using pip
```sh
$ pip install clarifai
$ pip install the client
```
##### Stratify requires [Python](https://www.python.org/) 3.6+ to run.

# Download
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/Alpha-github/image_classification.git
```


## Important Notes:
 ##### 1. Before running the app.py, make sure that you enter your api key given by Clarifai.
 #
 ##### 2. Make sure that the javascript and the css files are in their respective folders (namely js and css) which are placed in the main folder named static.
 #
 ##### 3. Create a separate folder (called "uploads") in the project directory to temporarily save the image, for it to be processed by your custom Clarifai model
 #
 ##### 4. Place all the program files in the same directory.
